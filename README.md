# Civic Connect
Welcome to CivicConnect by the Passionate Pythons (Group 2-27)! This application has three major sections

- Home Page
- Email Page
- Resources Page

Each of these sections is described in detail below. Note that all of the features have limited capability before logging in. To log in to the application, click the "Login" button in the top right corner of the screen and login using your Google account

## Home Page
On the home page you can lookup the contact information your own government officials by entering your address into the text field and clicking "Search". This will display contact information cards for each of your government officials (the system searches for the president, federal senators and representatives, and state senators and representatives). 

If you are logged into the system, you can check the "Save my contact info" box before search to save your address to your account. Once you have done this, the home page will automatically pull up your government officials whenever you are logged in. To change the address associated with your account, click the "Change Address" link, enter your new address, and click "Search". To log out of the system, click the "Sign Out" link at the top of the page.

## Resources Page
The Resources Page can be accessed by clicking "Resources" on the top navigation bar.

The main resources page lists articles/documents related to various issues, including built in resources from the site creators as well as resources submitted by site users. To filter the resource list by a key word or phrase enter it into the search bar in the top right.

To submit your own resource, click the "Add Resource" button at the bottom of the page. If you are not logged in, the system will redirect you to the login page. In the resource submission form, enter the title and url for your resource and select the issue to which it relates. **The application will require you to fill out each of these fields before submitting.** If you check the "Submit Resource Anonymously" button, the resource will be listed as "Submitted by Anonymous". Otherwise your username will be displayed as the submitter for that resource. When a resource is submitted it will be added to the database with a "Pending Approval" status. Once a site administrator changes its status to "Approved" it will be added to the public list of resources on the main page.

If you are logged in to the application, you will see star icons before each issue header. Click these stars to toggle on and off whether each issue is saved as one of your user's "Top Issues". Changes are saved to the database immediately. Top Issues have golden headers and will always be displayed at the top of the page whenever it is loaded.

## Email Page
The Email Page can be accessed by clicking "Email" on the top navigation bar. It can also be accessed by clicking on a government official's email address on the home page. 

The first step in the email process is choosing whether to write your email from scratch or to use a template. If you came to the page by clicking a contact's email address, that email address will be listed at the top of the page.

If you select "Send Email from Scratch", an empty email will be opened in your mail app (you must have the mail app setup on your computer for this to work). If you had already selecting an official to contact, that official's email will automatically be entered in the "to" field of the email.

If you select a template from the dropdown list, you will be directed to a page where you can fill out the custom components of the template. If you already select an official to contact, that official's name will already be filled in. Additionally, if you are logged into the system, your name will already be filled in as well. Once you fill in the empty fields, click "Preview" to see the email fully typed out. If the "Mail To" field is not already filled out (i.e. you have not yet selected someone to contact), you must fill out that field to proceed (the application will not proceed unless this field contains an email address). Click "Send Email" to open up a draft of the email in your mail app.
